    The first thing that I will do for this project is catagorize the requirements to make it 
easier to determine the order in which I need to implement the different components.

Core table elements:
Reqirements 1.1-1.3, 1.5

Game auxillary elements:
1.4, 1.6, 2.6

Core game logic:
1.7, 1.8

Level construction and loading:
1.9-1.11, 2.1

Server/database:
2.2-2.5


Website Architecture:
There should be 4 pages. There will be a title page, a page providing instructions, a
page providing information on the author, and a page where the user will actually 
play the game. There will be a navigation bar at the top of the page that will allow
the user to navigate between the different sections. The order of completion for the 
project pages should be the game page, then the title page, then the instruction page, 
then the author page.
