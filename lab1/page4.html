    <h2>Assembly Language</h2>
    <p>
        An assembly (or assembler) language,[1] often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.[2]
        <br><br>
        Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture and operating system.[3] In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code.[4][5]
        <br><br>
        Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction, but assembler directives,[6] macros[7][1] and symbolic labels of program and memory locations are often also supported.
        <br><br>
        Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler. The conversion process is referred to as assembly, or assembling the source code.
